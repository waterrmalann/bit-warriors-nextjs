> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This project is currently under heavy development.**

**\<BitWarriors/\>** is an AI-powered competitive coding platform designed to help beginners improve their programming skills and in turn their problem solving abilities. BitWarriors draws inspiration from platforms like [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) and [CodeWars](https://codewars.com/), offering a simplified and beginner friendly version.

**This repository** hosts the frontend of this project, built using the **MERN** stack, along with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org), and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## 🚀 Getting Started

>[!NOTE]
> **BitWarriors** is a project built using the Microservices architecture. Despite using NextJS, it is merely for the purpose of performing SSR on React. The application still needs to establish a connection with a separate backend API Gateway in order to work as intended. This is also under development [here](https://github.com/waterrmalann/bit-warriors-backend). Stay tuned for instructions to self-host!
